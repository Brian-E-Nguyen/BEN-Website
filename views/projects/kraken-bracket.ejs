        Whether it is for a local tournament or an organized tournament, <strong>Kraken Bracket</strong>
        makes tournament experiences smoother for tournament organizers, competitors, and spectators alike.

            Registered users have the ability to create tournament brackets and/or events. From there, other registered users 
            may sign up and participate in the brackets/events. Those who manage brackets can update scores and move players 
            in the brackets. Once a bracket is finished, the bracket's page will display the standings of all competitors, 
            which is viewable for all users
        </p>
        <p>
            All brackets support at minimum 4 players and at maximum 128 players; events encompass a collection of brackets 
            so users can follow and be updated for all brackets within a single event.

            <strong>NOTE:</strong> this project is neither finished nor deployed. This yearlong project was developed from 2019 to 2020, 
            and the coronavirus lockdowns caused many problems for me and my team
