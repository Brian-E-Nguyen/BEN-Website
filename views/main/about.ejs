            My name is Brian E. Nguyen and I graduated from California State University, Long Beach in May 2020 with a bachelor's 
            degree in computer science. I am currently seeking an internship or an entry-level position in full-stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the moment I have written my first script in Python, I knew that software development is the career choice for me. 
            It has allowed me to challenge myself and to improve on my skills, not just in programming, 
            but also on creativity and team-working. I hope to produce high-quality software and web applications that will be used and 
            appreciated by many.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working at Code Ninjas, Cerritos as a coding instructor. Working here combines two of my passions: 
            programming and working with kids. I tutor students with Scratch and JavaScript to help them 
            build video games. Also, I have developed and led my own coding camp that received 100% positive feedback from students.
        </p>
            I formerly served as the president of the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association at CSULB, a collegiate chapter of its 
            mother organization, the Tzu Chi Foundation. This volunteering organization focuses on humanitarian aid, medicine, education, and more. 
            I have devoted over 300 hours of my time serving this organization and it has been a life-changing experience for me. Various volunteering 
            activities include recording videos for Tzu Chi's news outlet, packing food at food distributions, tutoring children at tutoring centers, 
            and helping at medical outreaches. As an alumni, I continue to volunteer for the Tzu Chi Foundation and to support the CSULB chapter.
        </p>

            Other interests of mine include photography, drumming, video games, working out, playing with my dogs, and so much more.

            <h3>Programmer</h3>
            <p>
                I have 5 years of programming experience with many different languages, such as Java, Python, C#, HTML/CSS/JS, and with many 
                libraries & frameworks.

                To me, programming is like a puzzle. Problems will be presented to me, whether they will be application
                features that I need to add or bugs that I need to fix. These problems may take time to solve 
                or maybe frustrate me; however, in the long run, solving these problems brings me excitement and a sense of 
                accomplishment.

                Capturing my life and others' through my lens has always been my favorite artform. There is a vast
                world out full of people, moments, and things out there, and that makes me willing to pick up my
                DSLR and explore the world. I usually do this for fun, though I do offer paid services depending on
                the situation.

    <h2>Me vs. The World</h2>
    <p>
        I am always eager to learn new things every day, whether it will be related to programming, self-development, or things around me. I have
        never been more motivated in my life to improve myself and the lives of others. I hope that I can apply my many years of programming 
        knowledge to develop applications that will make a difference in the world.
