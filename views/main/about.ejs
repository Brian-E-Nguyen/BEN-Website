            My name is Brian E. Nguyen and I graduated from California State University, Long Beach in May 2020 with a bachelor's 
            degree in computer science. I am currently seeking an internship or an entry-level position in full-stack development.

            From the moment I have written my first script in Python, I knew that software development is the career choice for me. 
            Software development has allowed me to challenge myself and to improve on my skills, not just in programming, 
            but also on creativity and team-working. I hope to produce high-quality software and web applications that will be used and 
            appreciated by many.

            I am currently working at Code Ninjas, Cerritos as a coding instructor. Working here combines two of my passions: 
            programming and working with kids. I have tutored students with Scratch, JavaScript, and Lua languages to help them 
            build video games. In addition, I have developed and led my own coding camp that received 100% positive feedback from students.
        </p>
            I formerly served as the president for the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association at CSULB. This volunteering organization focuses 
            on humanitarian aid, medicine, education, and more. I have devoted over 300 hours of my time serving this organization and 
            it has been a life-changing experience for me.

            Other interests of mine include photography, drumming, video games,

            <p>
                From the moment I wrote my first lines of code in my introductory programming course, I knew that
                this is something that I wanted to do for a career. There is a vast pool of resources in computer
                science that I am eager to discover, and that pool will only continue to grow. I am always motivated
                to learn new things about it and to improve my skills.

            <p>
                Capturing my life and others' through my lens has always been my favorite artform. There is a vast
                world out full of people, moments, and things out there, and that makes me willing to pick up my
                DSLR and explore the world. I usually do this for fun, though I do offer paid services depending on
                the situation.
