### Personal Notes

Creating this website was more than two years in the making. I started developing this back in 2019 with the concepts that I have learned from [Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). The reason why this project took longer to complete was that I was eager to create my website midway through the course, so I used concepts that I already knew; however, I didn't know enough concepts to develop it, such as routing, file organization, components, and app deployment. This led me to become unmotivated to complete it sooner than I expected. I also had to take some time off from the boot camp to focus on my studies at CSULB.

After I graduated in 2020, I wanted to finish the boot camp to gain more knowledge on web development. It was a difficult and time-consuming journey, but it was all worth it in the end. I took the new concepts that I've learned from that boot camp and completely reworked my website.
